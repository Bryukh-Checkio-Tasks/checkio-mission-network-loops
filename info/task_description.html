    A routing loop is a common problem with various types of networks, particularly computer networks.
    Loops are the same as cycles in graphs. Let's learn how to find these cycles in a network.
</p>

<p>
    A cycle consists of a sequence of nodes starting and ending at the same node without repetitions of nodes,
    with each two consecutive nodes in the sequence connect to each other in the network.
    Cycle length is a quantity of nodes in it. The length of cycle should be great than 2.
    You should find the biggest cycle in a network, if we have several equal by size loops, then choose any of them.
</p>

<p>
    The nodes in the network are numbered and each connections are undirected. The length of edges are not substantial,
    so consider them as equal lengths. Some components of a network can be disconnected.
</p>
<p>
    The network is represented as a sequence of connections.
    Each connection is described by two two numbers -- which nodes are connected.
    The result should be represented as a sequence of numbers which start and end with the same number.
    If there is no cycles, then return an empty sequence.

    <img class="for_editor_only" title="example" src="{{MEDIA}}example.svg" alt="example" width="380px"/>
</p>

<p>
    For example this image will be described as: ((1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,5),(5,7),(7,6),(8,5),(8,4),(1,5),(2,4)).
    And the biggest loop have 6 nodes. It can be described as [1,2,3,4,5,8,1] (or [3,4,5,8,1,2,3]).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Connection information as a tuple of tuples of integers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The biggest cycle (or one of them) as a list/tuple of integers.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    Cycle detection is important for computer networks as we already said.
    And it can be used to detect deadlocks in concurrent programming.
